Angle-Sensor-Android-App
========================

An application for Android devices, which detects changes in position of the mobile device, and calls a given number, when a certain device position is reached. 

Useful for setting up alarm based on position changes, ex. fall of trapdoor latch.

Disclaimer: it's a "just make it work" type of code, rather messy, based on a couple examples I found on stackoverflow.
